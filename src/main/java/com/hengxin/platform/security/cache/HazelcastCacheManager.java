/**
 * A {@code CacheManager} implementation backed by <a href="http://www.hazelcast.com/">Hazelcast</a>,
 * &quot;an open source clustering and highly scalable data distribution platform for Java&quot;
 * <p/>
 * This implementation interacts with a {@link HazelcastInstance} to
 * {@link HazelcastInstance#getMap(String) acquire} named {@link java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap ConcurrentMap}
 * instances.  Those clustered/distributed Map instances are then wrapped and made available to {@code CacheManager}
 * callers as {@link MapCache} instances via {@link #getCache(String)}.
 * <h3>Configuration</h3>
 * This implementation's backing {@code HazelcastInstance} must be specified by calling
 * {@link #setHazelcastInstance(com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance) setHazelcastInstance}, either directly or via
 * Dependency Injection (shiro.ini, Spring, Guice, etc).
 * <p/>
 * DependencyInjection environments will likely find using either the
 * {@link org.apache.shiro.hazelcast.ClientHazelcastInstanceFactory} or the {@link org.apache.shiro.hazelcast.EmbeddedHazelcastInstanceFactory} factory implementations
 * convenient for specifying Hazelcast configuration that will be used to create the {@link HazelcastInstance}.
 * <h4>As a Hazelcast Client</h4>
 * <p>If your Shiro-enabled application is a client to a Hazelcast cluster, you will likely want to use the
 * {@link org.apache.shiro.hazelcast.ClientHazelcastInstanceFactory} to create a client hazelcast instance.  For example, if using
 * {@code shiro.ini}:<p/>
 * <pre>
 * hazelcast = org.apache.shiro.hazelcast.ClientHazelcastInstanceFactory
 * hazelcast.config.groupConfig.name = myClusterGroupName
 * hazelcast.config.addresses = 192.168.1.1, 192.168.1.2, 192.168.1.3
 *
 * cacheManager = org.apache.shiro.hazelcast.cache.HazelcastCacheManager
 * cacheManager.hazelcastInstance = $hazelcast
 * </pre>
 * <h4>As an Embedded Hazelcast Node</h4>
 * <p>If, instead of being a client to a Hazelcast cluster, you want your application to run with an embedded Hazelcast
 * server node (or be a server node peer to other server nodes), use the
 * {@link org.apache.shiro.hazelcast.EmbeddedHazelcastInstanceFactory} instead.  For example:<p/>
 * <pre>
 * [main]
 * hazelcast = org.apache.shiro.hazelcast.EmbeddedHazelcastInstanceFactory
 * hazelcast.config.groupConfig.name = myClusterGroupName
 * hazelcast.config.networkConfig.joinConfig.multicastConfig.enabled = false
 * hazelcast.config.networkConfig.joinConfig.tcpIpConfig.members = 192.168.1.1, 192.168.1.2, 192.168.1.3
 *
 * cacheManager = org.apache.shiro.hazelcast.cache.HazelcastCacheManager
 * cacheManager.hazelcastInstance = $hazelcast
 * </pre>
 *
 * @see org.apache.shiro.hazelcast.ClientHazelcastInstanceFactory
 * @see org.apache.shiro.hazelcast.EmbeddedHazelcastInstanceFactory
